# ML-Scratch

This is a python library with numpy implementations of common machine learning algorithms. This was built for educational purposes as a means to learn the details of machine learning algorithms for myself. I hope that others who are learning machine learning will benefit from viewing these numpy implementations.

Each algorithm listed below will have a **Code** link and **Notebook** link. The **Code** link directs you to the algorithm code within the library. The **Notebook** link demonstrates using the algorithm on data. 

## Linear Regression
Two solvers are implemented to fit data: (1) normal equations and (2) gradient descent.

- [Notebook](https://github.com/cjm715/ml_scratch/blob/master/notebooks/LinearRegression.ipynb)


## Logistic Regression
Two solvers are implemented to fit data: (1) gradient descent and (2) Newton's method.
