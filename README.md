# ML-Scratch

This is a python library with numpy implementations of common machine learning algorithms. This was built for educational purposes as a means to learn the details of machine learning algorithms for myself. I hope that others who are learning machine learning will benefit from view the numpy implementations.

## Linear Regression
Two solvers are implemented to fit data: (1) normal equations and (2) gradient descent.

## Logistic Regression
Two solvers are implemented to fit data: (1) gradient descent and (2) Newton's method.
